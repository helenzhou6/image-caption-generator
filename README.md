# Image Caption Generator

Aim: To take an image and generate a caption with **magic** (a.k.a a CLIP Visual Encoder + Custom Decoder)

## Pre-requisities 
- Python 3.10
- uv - install via https://github.com/astral-sh/uv
- wandb log in details and be added to the project - https://wandb.ai/site

## To dev
1. To setup: `uv sync` so you will download all needed dependencies
    - To recognise imported files, you may need to run `export PYTHONPATH=./src` in the terminal
    - To run python file: either use `uv run <file name>` will auto use the .venv that uv generates OR you can do `source .venv/bin/activate` to activate your virtual env and then run `python3 <file name>`
    - If you have VSCode on mac, you can do Shift, Command, P to open preferences, and select the .venv. Then you can press 'play' button and that will use it.
